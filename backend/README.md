I have created fronted UI using html and js.
For storing business layer seperatedly from my presentation layer, I have used node.js as my backend technology.
All html files have UI for relevant output required for the application.
In main.js, which is my frontend file has calling of apis for fetching my data form the backend to display candidate information and apis to send voting data to my backend.
In index.js, I have created all the GET and POST apis which are used to read and write my candidates information.
